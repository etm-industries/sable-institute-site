    <div class="section-label">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</div>
    <p>In 1996, Brooksley Born was appointed Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). She had spent her career in derivatives law. She understood the instruments. She understood the risks. And she understood that a $27 trillion market was operating with virtually no regulatory oversight, no transparency, and no margin requirements.</p>
    <p>She tried to regulate it. Three of the most powerful financial officials in the United States &mdash; Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin, and Larry Summers &mdash; objected publicly. They did not merely disagree. They mobilized the full weight of the federal government to stop her.</p>
    <p>Ten years later, the unregulated derivatives market she had warned about destroyed $10 trillion in American household wealth in a single year.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-label">THE WARNING</div>
    <p>In May 1998, the CFTC under Born issued a "concept release" &mdash; not a regulation, not a rule, but a formal request for public comment on whether over-the-counter derivatives required regulatory oversight. The document asked questions. It proposed nothing. It merely opened a conversation.</p>
    <p>The response was immediate and coordinated. Greenspan (Federal Reserve), Rubin (Treasury), and Summers (Deputy Treasury) issued a joint statement opposing the concept release. They argued that even raising the question of regulation would destabilize markets. Greenspan invoked the self-regulating nature of financial markets. Rubin warned of "legal uncertainty."</p>
    <p>Three of them objected publicly. Not privately. Not through back channels. They held a press conference to announce that the head of a federal regulatory agency should not be permitted to ask questions about the market she was legally charged with overseeing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-label">VINDICATION AND SUPPRESSION</div>
    <p>In September 1998 &mdash; four months after the concept release &mdash; Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapsed. The hedge fund had accumulated $1.25 trillion in derivatives exposure. Its failure threatened to trigger a systemic cascade. The Federal Reserve organized an emergency $3.6 billion bailout by a consortium of Wall Street banks.</p>
    <p>LTCM's collapse was precisely the kind of event Born had warned about. An unregulated derivatives position, invisible to regulators, large enough to threaten the entire financial system. The evidence was now empirical, not theoretical.</p>
    <p>It did not matter. Congress passed the <span class="emphasis">Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000</span>, which explicitly stripped the CFTC of authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives. The market Born had tried to bring into the light was formally exempted from oversight by federal law.</p>
    <p>Born's term ended in 1999. She returned to private practice. She did not serve in government again.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-label">THE CRISIS</div>
    <p>In 2007&ndash;2008, the unregulated derivatives market &mdash; specifically credit default swaps on mortgage-backed securities &mdash; triggered the most severe financial crisis since 1929. Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG collapsed. The global credit system froze. Unemployment reached 10%. <span class="emphasis">More than $10 trillion in household wealth was destroyed.</span></p>
    <p>In the aftermath, the same officials who had silenced Born's warning described the crisis as unforeseeable. Greenspan testified to Congress that he had found a "flaw" in his ideology. He did not mention the woman who had identified that flaw a decade earlier and been publicly overruled for it.</p>
    <p>The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's final report (2011) concluded that the crisis was "avoidable." It cited the deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives as a primary cause.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-label">MECHANISM ANNOTATION</div>
    <p class="annotation">She identified the exact mechanism that would trigger the crisis. She was silenced by the people who later claimed the crisis was unforeseeable. This is Mechanism 3 (Institutional Silencing) &mdash; the suppression of warnings not through corporate action but through the coordinated opposition of the institutions that should have been allies. The regulator was overruled by the regulators. The person with statutory authority was told she did not have the right to exercise it. And when the catastrophe she predicted came to pass, the people who stopped her rewrote the history to make it sound like no one could have known.</p>
